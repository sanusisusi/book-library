## Setup Instructions
- `git clone https://github.com/sanusisusi/Book-Library.git`
- `cd Book-Library`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
Your browser will open A Live Version of your Book Library!
> If you are using `yarn`, you can use `yarn install` and `yarn start` instead of using `npm`!

## How it works?
The Book Library isn't really customizable yet, but it will be. Its data is generated from `src/BooksAPI.js` API file, this file is retrieving the data by fetching this URL `https://reactnd-books-api.udacity.com` . This can be customizable if you replaced the `api` variable with your own custom API URL, but make sure that it doesn't conflict with the current scripts.
